        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>The Name Game is a very simple game in nature that brings excitement and quick thinking to any gathering. It can be played with as few as 2 players or as many players that a group contains.</p>
        
        <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The game begins with the youngest player reciting any person's name, as long as 50% of the players participating know who the person is.</li>
            <li>Names can be famous, a family member, friend, fictional personality, or anything that constitutes a "name."</li>
            <li>Play moves clockwise around the group.</li>
            <li>Each player must give a name that starts with the first letter of the previous player's response's last name.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong>
            <p>Player A says "Adam Sandler" → Player B must use a name starting with "S"<br>
            If Player B says "Sherlock Holmes" → Player C must use a name starting with "H"</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Special Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Thinking Time:</strong> While a player is thinking of a name, they must "drink while they think." If after 10 seconds a player is unable to give a name, they are eliminated from the game.</li>
            <li><strong>No Repeats:</strong> At no point can a name be repeated. If a name is repeated, that player must continue to "drink while they think."</li>
            <li><strong>Single Names:</strong> For names with only one word (like "Beyoncé" or "Garfield"), the starting letter for the next player is just the first letter of that name.</li>
            <li><strong>Double Letters:</strong> If a "double lettered" name is given (like "Severus Snape"), play continues in the opposite direction. There are no limits on the number of times a double lettered name can be given in a row.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="important">
            <strong>Important Note:</strong> The name given must be known by at least 50% of the players participating in the game.
